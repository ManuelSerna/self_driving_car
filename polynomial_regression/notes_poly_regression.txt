Polynomial regression
---------------------------------------

- Before we looked at classification whose sole purpose was to group the output into some class.
- Linear regression is used to predict continuous values based on a line that best models the relationship which best models the relationship between the indenpendent X and the dependent variable y.
    - continuous spectrum.
    - Linear regression is the simplest form of regression.

- We train a linear regression model by minimizing the loss over our data which would correspond to the mean squared error.

* Mean squared error: measures the average of the squares of the errors--that is, he average squared difference between the estimated values and what is estimated. A measure of the quality of an estimator, and always non-negative.

    - Smaller mse == smaller error == the better the estimator.
                  n
    MSE = (1/n) * E(fi - yi)^2
                 i=1
    Where n is the number of data points,
    fi the value returned by the model, and
    yi the actual value for data point i.
