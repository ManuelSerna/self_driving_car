# Self Driving Car Project

This repository contains all the projects used to develop a simulated self-driving car using various data science and computer vision libraries. I first learned about the fundamentals of machine learning from Udemy; even though machine learning is not "my cup of tea" like I thought, my interest in computer vision started in part from here. Thus I still think this is an important repo.
